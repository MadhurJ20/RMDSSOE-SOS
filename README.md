A SOS app I created for my University to promote Women Safety.

3. Make sure your device location is enabled.
4. Shake your phone vigorously 3 times. The device vibrates to confirm that the message is sent.
5. The SMS is sent from your phone. If location is enabled, a Google Maps link is attached, else it sends a simple alert message.
